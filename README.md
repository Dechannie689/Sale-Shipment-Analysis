# Sale & Shipment Analysis - Power BI
Abstract
The Marketing Campaign Dashboard visualizes key insights to provide a comprehensive overview of campaign performance in Power BI, leveraging a dataset sourced from marketing_campaign.csv. It provides a centralized hub for dissecting and optimizing the performance of marketing campaigns, enabling data-driven decision-making and helping businesses maximize their marketing ROI.

Make better decisions by getting a 360° view of your shipment performance. This dashboard can help you monitor, analyze and understand the monthly, quarterly, and semi-annual performance of a shipper. Using this dashboard, you can know the shipment performance across regions, get an overview of the shipment delay, and understand the important customers better.

Data Manipulation
Prior to analysis, I imported the dataset into Power BI and transformed it on Power Query Editor. Here are the step-by-step manipulations done on the source datasets:

Step 1: Creation of Product & Amount Spend Column
To better analyze the data, I used the Unpivot Columns feature in Power Query to transform "MntWines" column, "MntFruits" column, "MntMeatProducts" column, "MntFishProducts" column, "MntSweetProducts" column, "MntGoldProds" column into "Product" and "Amount Spend" column.
Then, I used the Replace Values function to make the “Product” column more readable.
Step 2: Creation of Campaign & Accepted Status Column
Similarly, I used the Unpivot Columns feature to transform "AcceptedCmp1" column, "AcceptedCmp2" column, "AcceptedCmp3" column, "AcceptedCmp4" column, "AcceptedCmp5" column into "Campaign" and "Accepted Status" column.
Then, I used the Replace Values function to make the “Campaign” column more readable.
Step 3: Creation of Purchase and Number of Purchase Column
Likewise, I used the Unpivot Columns feature to transform "NumWebPurchases" column, "NumCatalogPurchases" column, "NumStorePurchases" column, "NumDealsPurchases" column into "Purchase" and "Number of Purchase" column.
Then, I used the Column from examples function to make the “Purchase” column more readable.
